# Re-creating the New York Times' Classic Vizualization of New York City's Weather in 2003#

##Created using NOAA Weather Data, Python and D3.js##

###Original Visualization###

This is a favorite of Edward Tufte. In *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*, he cites it as an exemplar of
high-data-density visualization, quoting a density of "better than 300 numbers per square inch"

###D3.js Recreation###
This repo hosts a D3.js recreation of this visualization, made as a submission for an initial D3.js assignment for the
class [Data Visualization & Communication](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/academics/curriculum/data-visualization/)
in the UC Berkeley Master of Information and Data Science program.

It is an initial effort only, and is currently work in progress. Subsequent iterations will clean up the code base,
using Mike Bostock's [convention for reusable charts](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/) add a range of interactions,
including the ability to select other cities and other years.
